The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue where the expected specificity rules are not applied correctly due to a subtle combination of selectors and inheritance:

```css
.container {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.container p {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.container span {
  font-size: 14px;
}

.container span.emphasized {
  font-size: 20px;
}

.container p span {
  font-size: 16px; /* Unexpected! */
}
```

In this example, we expect the nested `<span>` within the paragraph to inherit and override the `font-size` set for the paragraph, and the selector `.container p span` is applied. However, due to specificity calculation, it ends up using the `font-size` set for the `.container` which is unexpected.
